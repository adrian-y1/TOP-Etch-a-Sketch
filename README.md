## Difficulties

At the beginning of the project, I found it challenging to create a grid layout with rows and columns that would be suitable for the pixels in each grid.

## Overcoming difficulties

To overcome this challenge, I started by researching different grid systems and experimenting with various CSS properties. After some testing, I found the CSS properties that worked well for creating the desired layout. Additionally, I utilized for loops in JavaScript to dynamically generate each pixel in the grid of the canvas as well as making the rows and columns of the grid based on user input. By breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks and utilizing available resources, I was able to successfully overcome the initial difficulties and create a functional Etch-a-Sketch app.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, developing the Etch-a-Sketch app was a fun project that allowed me to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project required me to think critically about how to create the grid layout and implement various features such as the eraser, clear board, and customizable pen colors. Through researching and experimenting with for loops and event listeners, I was able to successfully overcome these challenges and create a fully functional and responsive app. This project not only helped me solidify my understanding of front-end web development but also provided me with practical experience that I can apply to future projects. Overall, I am proud of the finished product and the skills I gained throughout the development process.
